                        <li><a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/alcohol-and-adolescent-brain#:~:text=For%20adolescents%2C%20drinking%20alcohol%20can,brain%20region%20called%20the%20amygdala">Alcohol and the Adolescent Brain</a></li>
                        <li>Summary: "People often begin to drink alcohol and use other substances during adolescence. Although adolescents tend to drink alcohol less often than adults, they tend to drink more when they do drink. 
                            In general, underage drinking can lead adolescents to make poor decisions and engage in potentially harmful behavior-e.g., drinking and driving, unsafe sexual behavior, and other substance use"
                            This connects to my question because it shows the effects of how alcohol affects teens' development growth and their rationality especially when they drink alcohol.</li>

                        <li> Summary: "President Ronald Reagan signed into law the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which withheld a percentage of highway funds from any state that didn't raise the minimum drinking age to 21. 
                            Binge drinking can have a damaging impact on a developing brain. Evidence suggests that heavy exposure to alcohol can cause irreversible brain damage."
                            This shows the way people were trying to raise the age for restricted rights so this could help any adolescent to make the correct decisions when their brain was still developing.</li>
