                            <li> Summary: "Although adolescents tend to drink alcohol less often than adults, they tend to drink more when they do drink. 
                                Approximately 8.2% percent of people ages 12 to 20—or 3.2 million—reported binge drinking in the past month.3,4
                                Alcohol misuse during adolescence—generally measured by a history of binge drinking or alcohol use disorder diagnosis—has been linked to changes within and between brain regions." 
                                This connects to my question because they are talking about how drinking can affect teens and how there is research proving how damaging it can be to them later in life.</li>

                                <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ju0iiLaNVCVUwqTeAA7vEIoem2-tJ_45A7rlghLE88s/edit"> Why the Drinking Age Is 21 in the United States</a></li>
                                <li> Summary: "Research evidence after that time strongly suggested that an increase in traffic accidents among young people was linked with this downward shift in the minimum legal drinking age
                                    Raising the minimum drinking age has led to less drinking overall, among all young adults, even with easy access to alcohol."
                                    This connects because teens underage drinking rate had been lowered due to America raising the drinking age. So raising the age for alcohol helped teens think it through and not drink alcohol.</li>
